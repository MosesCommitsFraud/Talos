# that runs as root writes root-owned files into bind-mounted host
# volumes, and the host user (or a non-root service user) then can't
# update them — silently breaking skill extraction, prefs saves, mail
# attachments, etc.
#
# Standard PUID/PGID pattern: pick the UID/GID we should drop to,
# chown the writable bind-mounts so existing root-owned content gets
# repaired on every start (idempotent), then exec the real command
# as that user via gosu.

# Repair ownership on every writable path the app touches at runtime.
#
# Bind-mounted dirs (/app/data, /app/logs) are the obvious ones, but
# the app ALSO writes inside the image's own source tree at runtime:
#   - services/cache/{search,content}/*  (search cache LRU)
#   - services/search_analytics.json
#   - services/search_engine_error.log
#   - services/tts cache, etc.
# These dirs were created as root during `docker build`, so dropping
# to PUID:PGID would otherwise crash on the first import that tries
# to mkdir them. Chown the whole /app tree — fast (<1s on this size)
# and idempotent via the `-not -uid` filter so we only touch files
# that need fixing.
# Uploads live in a named volume (TALOS_UPLOAD_DIR, default /srv/uploads in
# Docker) that's also mounted into the sandbox. A FRESH named volume is created
# root-owned, so the non-root app can't write to it — every upload fails with
# EPERM ("all file uploads failed") until we chown it here too.
